# Purpose

I prefer simplicity and customizability instead of complexity and ease of use.
That being said I didn't feel as though there were enough simple easy-to-use
text editors available. So I decided to build this one. I'm attempting to make
it as simple as possible and configurable so that anyone who has a small amount
of C knowledge can add features that they'd like.

For now running myTerm is as simple as running `make` in the base directory. You will need both the `curses` library and the `menu` library. Both of these should already be installed on most UNIX systems by default.
